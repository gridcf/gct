Grid Community Toolkit
======================

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/gridcf/gct.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/gridcf/gct)

This is the official git repository for the Grid Community Toolkit (GCT). Find the documentation on https://gridcf.org/gct-docs/.

The GCT is a nascent effort by the [Grid Community Forum (GridCF)](https://gridcf.org/) to provide community-based support for critical software packages for grid computing.

The GCT is based on a fork of the Globus Toolkit but is not the Globus Toolkit.  If you are interested in the Globus Toolkit, you can find it at <http://toolkit.globus.org>.


Major Components
-----------------

Major components in the GCT include:

- *GSI*: The Grid Security Infrastructure, an implementation of an authentication and authorization infrastructure based upon the concept of X509 proxy certificates.
  The GSI packages include client and server code necessary to create and verify proxies.
- *GridFTP*: An implementation of a client and server for the GridFTP protocol.
- *MyProxy*: A credential management service tailored for GSI.
